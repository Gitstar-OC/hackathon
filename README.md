# Hackathon Participation

This is my [Gitstar-OC](https://github.com/gitstar-oc) second github account and this repository is being forked to add license to it as any modifications to original hackathon will disqualify me.

## How to run the code 

- clone the repository first and move into it
- For `Frontend` run `npm install` and then  `npm run dev` this will install all the dependencies. Note that you can also use `yarn` or `pnpm` for this
- For `Backend` move to backend and then activate environment using `python3 -m venv venv`
- Activate it on mac using `source venv/bin/activate` or on windows using `venv\Scripts\activate`
